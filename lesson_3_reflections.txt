When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Surely this would be a necessity when working in groups? Unless there is a way for groups working on the same network or whatever (I don't know anything) to locally share a project -- then a remote repository wouldn't be necessary for them all to access the code. In that case I suppose the benefit to having a remote repository would be the ability to access the code anywhere? Even then I am not sure this is impossible "locally," since I don't know what that means.
